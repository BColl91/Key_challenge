<!--In the body, I added a header to welcome and briefly explain how the site works. In the 'result' div I created 3 ids labeled as appropiate (which will be called in JS), I linked the js in the 'container' div and added a friendly line at the end of the body which is classed seperatly as 'yay' to ensure it stays in place oin the site.-->
