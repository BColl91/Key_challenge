Week 3 KeyCode Challenge


This features my rendition of a generic KeyCode website. I added some background colour to make it more welcoming and lively. I added a white container to ensure that the content itself is still easy to read.

It should allow you to press any key on your keyboard and return the key itself, the Key code and the which, the which shows what number the key pressed is.

This challenge has shown me that I am confident in JavaSCript, but still in need of development in CSS and HTML, as I struggled to get the layout to look presentable until I got assistance from ChatGPT.
